# Fyre Festival Bed Piss Guy Simulator 2019

an unfinished game about [this guy](https://nextshark.com/justin-liao-fyre-festival-netflix/)


### install 

```
npm install
npm start
```

### mechanics
- people are attracted to tents which aren't ruined
- you can ruin tents by pissing on them or attacking them
- both of these drain resources (piss and energy respectively)
- these can be replenished with water and food
- when a tent is isolated one of your bros will occupy it
- other festivalgoers will be hoarding tents and resources at the same time,
so you better hurry


### nice to have
- people arrive on a bus
- billy gets up on the table and tells everyone to find a tent
- people fighting over stuff
- sad environmental dialog from festivalgoers
- swimming?

### dialogue
- "Where can I charge my drone?"
- "I'm making sure to shoot in both horizontal & vertical video formats"
- "I quit my job to come to this"
