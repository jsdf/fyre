# Fyre Festival Bed Piss Guy Simulator 2019

> These are the days we're gonna remember for the rest of our lives

### mechanics
- people are attracted to tents which aren't ruined
- you can ruin tents by pissing on them or attacking them
- both of these drain resources (piss and energy respectively)
- these can be replenished with water and food
- when a tent is isolated one of your bros will occupy it
- other festivalgoers will be hoarding tents and resources at the same time,
so you better hurry

### stuff to build
- collision detection for people vs tents, pickups etc
- pathfinding for festivalgoers to get to tents, pickups etc
- algo for deciding if a tent is isolated or not

### nice to have
- people arrive on a bus
- billy gets up on the table and tells everyone to find a tent
- people fighting over stuff
- sad environmental dialog from festivalgoers
- swimming?
